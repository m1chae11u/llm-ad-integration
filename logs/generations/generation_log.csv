If that sounds like you, this sophisticated scale replica of the SPAD S.XIII is sure to light your fire. Though the WWI French biplane fighter was piloted by such notable aviators as the legendary Eddie Rickenbacker, this miniature model pays tribute to Georges Guynemer, one of France's top aces during the Great War. While its stunningly accurate, first-rate paint job is certainly impressive, the plane's meticulous recreation of the SPAD S.XIII runs much deeper. Just take a look at its 8-cylinder Hispano-Suiza 8Be engine, its two-blade wooden scimitar prop, its interplane struts & bracing, and its old-school main landing gear and you'll notice 100% spot-on accuracy from tip to tail. Makes a fantastic gift for a hard-core airplane aficionado, as well as a top-notch aeronautical adornment for the home or office.
